# The multiomics landscape of small peptides encoded by long non-coding RNA-derived sORFs in rice

## Introdution
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack canonical protein-coding potential. They perform diverse regulatory, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, RNA processing, and post-transcriptional control. Despite being traditionally considered non-coding, increasing evidence indicates that many lncRNAs contain small open reading frames (sORFs) capable of encoding peptides, which can participate in the regulation of important growth and developmental processes in both plants and animals. Here, we applied a multi-omics workflow to identify lncRNA-derived sORF-encoded peptides across the rice genome.
